# Inspiration

The Cyber Security market is one of the fastest growing segments in the IT industry. As technology advances and becomes more sophisticated, cyber threats are becoming more complex and sophisticated as well.

The main focus for traditional anti-virus and firewall solutions has been to detect and block known threats. However, attackers continue to develop new techniques that allow them to evade traditional security controls.

The solution lies in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find unknown threats before they can cause damage. Guardix offers a comprehensive AI-based solution that uses real-time analysis of network traffic through machine learning algorithms and behavioral analytics to identify and block malicious activity before it can cause damage.
